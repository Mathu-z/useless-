### Project Description
A useless web page where pressing random keys causes random, hilarious, or infuriating effects ‚Äî shaking elements, glitch sounds, popups, flying emojis, and more. But here's the twist:
üí• Pressing Esc shows a bold popup saying "NO ESCAPE üíÄ" ‚Äî proving there's literally no way out.
